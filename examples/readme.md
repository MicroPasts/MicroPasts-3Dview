## 3D Model Metadata ##

This is an informal set of metadata for a 3D model produced via the
MicroPasts crowdsourcing web platform (http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org).

### General Information ###

This object is a Bronze Age 'palstave' (a kind of axe) and was found near Jevington, East Sussex in a hoard of 8 palstaves. It is now part of the British Museum's collections (BM 1991.3-3.5).


### Available Data ###

We have created three models: a textured mesh with 100k faces, another
with 300k faces, and the original dense point cloud. The raw images,
image masks and exported information about camera position and alignment markers are also available.

### Processing and Quality Assessment ###

This model was created in PhotoScan Pro 1.04.

The photographs used in this model were an experimental early set
taken on a tripod, but with automatic settings and in poor to average interior lighting
conditions. A lack of focus in some parts of the photos has had
consequences for the quality of the final model. Note that we did not
colour-balance the photographs first.
